# File: managers/system_manager.py
"""System Manager for ChoreOps integration.

The "Janitor" - handles entity registry cleanup via reactive signals.

Platinum Architecture Principles:
- REACTIVE: Listens to DELETED signals, does NOT get called directly by other managers
- ISOLATED: No imports from other managers, only entity_helpers and const
- STARTUP: Runs safety net cleanup once during async_setup()

Entity Cleanup Strategy:
1. TARGETED (Domain Managers): When ChoreManager.delete_chore() runs, it calls
   entity_helpers.remove_entities_by_item_id() directly for that specific chore.
2. REACTIVE (SystemManager): Listens to *_DELETED signals for cross-domain cleanup
    (e.g., when a user is deleted, scrub any remaining user-related entities).
3. SAFETY NET (Startup): Runs remove_all_orphaned_entities() once to catch any
   orphans from crashes, incomplete deletes, or edge cases.

Signals Consumed:
- SIGNAL_SUFFIX_USER_DELETED: Scrub user entities from registry
- SIGNAL_SUFFIX_CHORE_DELETED: Scrub chore entities from registry
- SIGNAL_SUFFIX_REWARD_DELETED: Scrub reward entities from registry
- SIGNAL_SUFFIX_BADGE_DELETED: Scrub badge entities from registry
